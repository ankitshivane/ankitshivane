## Hi there 👋

Brooo I’ve got you. 💪
This is going to look *clean, senior-level, and recruiter-attracting* — not the generic “Hi there 👋” template stuff.

I used your resume details  and structured this like a proper Senior Backend Engineer profile.

You can copy-paste this entire content into your `README.md`.
